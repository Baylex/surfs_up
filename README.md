1. The mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December.  However, the opposite is true for precipiation.  December had the higher precipitation of .22 inches while June had .14 inches.

2. Grouping the data into 15 bins, the histograms visually show how the frequency centers around the two different means.  For consistency of the graphs, the ranges of the axes were generated as the same for easier comparison using the minimum and maximum numbers from the descriptive statistics.  Using the same range for the temperatures, June appears to have a slight left skew, where December is more symmetrical.

3. As an addinonal query, the June and December months were filtered from the date.  The temperatrue and precipation data was then graphed as a scatterplot with a trendline.  Reading the slopes of the trendline equations, June (slope = -.037) has a steeper slope than December (slope = -.019), which means as the temperature increases, the precipation decreases more sharply in June than in December.  

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
